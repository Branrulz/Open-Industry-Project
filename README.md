# OpenIndustryProject

Free and Open-source PLC driven warehouse/manufacturing simulation made with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [libplctag.NET](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag.NET). 

The goal is to provide an open platform for developers to contribute to the creation of virtual industrial equipment/devices and for people to be able to test their ideas or simply educate themselves using a real PLC.

Supported PLCs:

ControlLogix,Micro800/850,PLC-5 ,SLC 500,MicroLogix,Omron NX/NJ Series,Modbus TCP

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and select the project folder directly in Unity Hub

Inside the Unity Editor add a PLC object from the 'Assets' folder to the scene and fill in the script fields with the necessary data for your test bench.

All equipment and devices come with their own script and fields that also need to be configured

## Help Wanted

More equipment and devices,
better models,
better performance,
better exception handling,
remove the need to recompile scripts after running
