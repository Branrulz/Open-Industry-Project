# OpenIndustryProject

Free and Open-source PLC driven warehouse/manufacturing simulation made with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [libplctag.NET](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag.NET). 

The goal is to provide an open platform for developers to contribute to the creation of virtual industrial equipment/devices and for people to be able to test their ideas or simply educate themselves using a real PLC.

Supported PLCs:

ControlLogix,Micro800/850,PLC-5 ,SLC 500,MicroLogix,Omron NX/NJ Series,Modbus TCP

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and select the project folder directly in Unity Hub

The intent is to utilize the abilities of the Unity Editor itself to instantitate equiptment and design your systems. There, objects can be resized, moved around, and adjusted in real-time while the scene is running. It is possible if desired to build your scene into an executable, which can be then used as presentation material. 

Inside the Unity Editor add a PLC object from the 'Assets' folder to the scene and fill in the script fields with the necessary data for your test bench.

All equipment and devices come with their own script and fields that also need to be configured
